# Web 2 - Midterm: Movie Web App

**Goal:** Design and build a movie website app where it displays the trending movies and TV series of the day. The website should also include a search bar which the user can use to search.

## Instructions ‚úîÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create the necessary branches for development such as `dev`. Do not work on the `main` branch.
3. Create your wireframe and design on Figma or Whimsical. There is an example wireframe provided but you can create your own! Make sure to give your website your own unique name as well. For example: **FunMovies.com, MidnightPopcorn, FilmBuffs, etc.** Create your own logo for the website.
4. For the API, use TMDB API to retrieve the data [https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started]. You need to create an account because an API key is needed to make requests. Read their documentation on how to send a GET request.
5. You can use different libraries to build your project. This includes jQuery, carousels, sliders, or for those who want to use React, you can!
6. Commit and push your changes. Before the presentation day, make sure to create a pull request to the `main` branch.

## Features üíª

You can create more features but your movie website should have at least these:

- **Responsive** - The website must be responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Dark/Light Mode** - The website should have a dark and light mode which the user can switch between by clicking on a button or icon.
- **Search** - The user should be able to search for movies/tv shows. You don't need to have a separate page to show the results. You can add the search box on the header depending on your design.

## Pages üìÑ

You can create more pages but your movie website should have at least these:

- **Home** - Your homepage should display the trending movies and TV shows of the day.
- **About** - Information about your movie website.

## API Endpoints

Below are some of the endpoints you might use on the website. You are free to use more.

- [https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/trending-movies]
- [https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/trending-tv]
- [https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-keyword]
- [https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-multi]

## Presentation üìΩÔ∏è

Each student needs to present their project for at least 10 minutes. Present and explain your Figma design and show off all your features and pages.

*Good luck!*
